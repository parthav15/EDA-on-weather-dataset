# Exploratory Data Analysis on Weather Dataset
# Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a weather dataset. The dataset is a time-series collection of per-hour information detailing weather conditions at a specific location. The recorded parameters include temperature, dew point temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, visibility, pressure, and overall weather conditions.

# Key Features
1. Data Exploration: Utilized the Pandas library to explore and analyze the temporal variations in weather conditions.

2. Statistical Analysis: Conducted statistical analyses to uncover relationships between different weather parameters and identify notable trends.

# Dataset
The weather dataset provides a comprehensive set of hourly observations, allowing for in-depth exploration and analysis. The key variables recorded in the dataset are:

1. Temperature
2. Dew Point Temperature
3. Relative Humidity
4. Wind Speed
5. Visibility
6. Pressure
7. Overall Weather Conditions
8. Files
